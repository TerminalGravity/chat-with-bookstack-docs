Run export to get the book stack docs downloaded to 'data' dir

I've set up a demo using Streamlit and Gradio for LangChain and LlamaIndex respectively. 

app_gr.py:
this will ingest client specific info from the 'data' directory and make separate vector stores for each client specific book pages, the gradio app has the chat and allows you to change the vector store you query
